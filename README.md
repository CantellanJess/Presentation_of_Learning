## 💡 Project Overview

"Presentation of Learning" is a tool designed to support students—particularly high school or college-aged—in organizing their personal and academic growth into a compelling final presentation. It includes guided prompts, content sections, and visual layout tools to help learners articulate their journey and reflect on their experiences.

Originally developed as a school-based tool, this version expands on the idea with digital structure and interactivity.
